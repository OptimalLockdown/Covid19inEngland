Questions and Answers (for the public and media)
=================================================

1. What is this project?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Has two phases - current model and later on, effects of restriction measures. Who is working on these, links to university profiles. 

2. How does this model differ from others that predict the spread of Covid-19?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Refer to and link e.g. IHME model and explain very shortly the difference. Refer to and link article about model used by UK government, that it is not public, etc. 

- Possibly mention that you are interested in other models, and people can get in touch with you if they know of some?


(If the prediction is very different, especially if a lot more deaths etc: 

3. Why do you predict a lot more deaths than other models?)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

4. What assumptions have been made in this model?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


E.g. that this prediction assumes that the lockdown stays in place and compliance continues on the same level?

5. This prediction looks scary. Are you sure it is correct? Are there any caveats?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- A short explanation about how models are always a simplification of complex reality. 
- About error. 
- About variation - are the graphs you show the average of a range etc?
- Caveats - regarding the accuracy of data used. Regarding the assumptions you have made in the model (like people over 70 no longer meet anyone etc.) that are overly simplified? 

6. How can I get in touch with the researchers behind this study?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



7. How should I interpret the uncertainty predicted by this model?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
