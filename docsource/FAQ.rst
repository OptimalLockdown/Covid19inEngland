Questions and Answers (for the public and media)
=================================================

1. What is this project?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project presently focuses on developing cutting-edge epidemic models tailored to the UK population, calibrating them with approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) using data from the spread of COVID-19 in the UK provided by Public Health England (PHE), the National Health Service (NHS) and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) rather than using global estimates of parameters of transmission dynamics. We also integrate `Google mobility data <https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/>`_ in our model to reflect the affects of the lockdown on the UK population. Lorenzo Pacchiardi of Department of statistics, University of Oxford  and `Dr. Ritabrata Dutta of Department of statistics, University of Warwick <https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/dutta/>`_ are presently working on improving the epidemic model by integrating data about commuting patterns of UK citizens constructed from the 2011 census data; 

Further, `Dr. Susana Gomes of Department of mathematics, University of Warwick <https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/gomes/>`_ and `Dr. Dante Kalise of School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Nottingham <https://sites.google.com/view/dkalise>`_ are working on using these models with control theory-based techniques to design an optimal strategy of how to impose a lock-down (e.g., what commuting routes to allow, what retail to close, etc.) and exit this lock-down when the time comes (what and when to reopen), responding daily to the data from PHE, NHS and ONS. 

2. How does this model differ from others that predict the spread of Covid-19?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Refer to and link e.g. IHME model and explain very shortly the difference. Refer to and link article about model used by UK government, that it is not public, etc. 

- Possibly mention that you are interested in other models, and people can get in touch with you if they know of some?


(If the prediction is very different, especially if a lot more deaths etc: 

3. How should I interpret the uncertainty predicted by this model?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

4. Why do you predict a lot more deaths than other models?)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

5. What assumptions have been made in this model?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Three main assumptions we have used to develop our epidemic model are, 

- Tested people are composed mostly of the ones who needed clinical care at the hospital

- Restrictive measures as of the 9th April will be kept in place for the prediction horizon

- Once people are tested positive and admitted into hospital, they are isolated, not being able anymore of transmitting the infection.

Other assumptions are explained in :ref:`Epidemic model <Model>`.

6. This prediction looks scary. Are you sure it is correct? Are there any caveats?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- A short explanation about how models are always a simplification of complex reality. 
- About error. 
- About variation - are the graphs you show the average of a range etc?
- Caveats - regarding the accuracy of data used. Regarding the assumptions you have made in the model (like people over 70 no longer meet anyone etc.) that are overly simplified? 

7. How can I get in touch with the researchers behind this study?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
