# Introduction

We aim of this project is to shed light on how models to predict the evolution of an epidemics work, applied 
specifically to the COVID-19 epidemics in England. 

We are using a compartmental model, which splits the population into different _compartments_, representing different 
possible states (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered and Deceased). The evolution over time is represented by some 
equations which assume the population is well mixed.
