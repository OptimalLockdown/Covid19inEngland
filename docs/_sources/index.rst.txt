COVID-19 in England
===================
The aim of this project is to predict daily evolution of COVID-19 pandemic in England and to help policy makers decide how to best act to control the spread of the disease. We aim to create a public discourse about transparent science at the time of crisis, based on cutting edge epidemic models calibrated on daily numbers of hospitalized and deaths (age-structured).
